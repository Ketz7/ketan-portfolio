          I’m a passionate Software Engineer with over half a decade of experience building
          scalable backend systems, cloud-native architectures, and data pipelines. My
          journey started with a degree in Electrical & Electronics from Northumbria
          University (UK), and evolved into working on FastAPI microservices, AWS ETL
          solutions, and RAG-based search engines. I thrive in remote environments
          collaborating with international teams, and I’m eager to bring my expertise
          to a forward-thinking company.
